# Astrostatistics-Project

This repository contains implementations and experiments focused on noise reduction in astronomical imaging. It includes classical and deep learning-based denoising techniques, applied to the field of astrostatistics.

## Contents

- **BM3D**: Implementation of the BM3D (Block-Matching and 3D Filtering) algorithm for image denoising.
- **DnCNN Matlab**: MATLAB implementation of the DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) model.
- **DnCNN and Noise2Noise**: Python implementations of DnCNN and the Noise2Noise framework for unsupervised denoising.

## Features

- Comparison of classical and deep learning-based denoising approaches.
- Code for training and evaluating models on noisy astronomical datasets.
- MATLAB and Python scripts for reproducibility.
